    <h2>Groovy - An agile dynamic language for the Java Platform<br/>(JavaDoc for Java classes)</h2>

    Groovy...
    <ul>
      <li>is an agile and <strong>dynamic language</strong> for the <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong></li>
      <li>builds upon the strengths of Java but has <strong>additional power features</strong> inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk</li>
      <li>makes <strong>modern programming features</strong> available to Java developers with <strong>almost-zero learning curve</strong></li>
      <li>supports <strong>Domain-Specific Languages</strong> and other compact syntax so your code becomes <strong>easy to read and maintain</strong></li>
      <li>makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its <strong>powerful processing primitives</strong>, OO abilities and an Ant DSL</li>
      <li>increases developer productivity by <strong>reducing scaffolding code</strong> when developing web, GUI, database or console applications</li>
      <li><strong>simplifies testing</strong> by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box</li>
      <li>seamlessly <strong>integrates with all existing Java objects and libraries</strong></li>
      <li>compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java</li>
    </ul>
