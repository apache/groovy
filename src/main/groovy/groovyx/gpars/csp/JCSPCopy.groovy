    /**
     * The interface <code>JCSPCopy</code> is used to define a <code>copy</code> method
     * that is used to make a deep copy of an object.  In parallel systems an <code>object</code>
     * is used to encapsulate data only.  When an <code>object</code> is communicated from one process
     * to another then an object reference  is passed from the outputting process to the inputting one,
     * if the processes are on the same processor.  This would mean that two processes could modify the
     * same object in parallel, which of course is very dangerous.  One of the processes has to make
     * a copy of the object if they are both to work on the same object at the same time.  This can be
     * achieved by always declaring new objects for each iteration of a process, which is wasteful of
     * memory, or by copying the object.  The interface <code>JCSPCopy</code> gives the basic
     * definition of such a <code>copy</code> method.
     *
     * If an <code>object</code> is communicated over a network channel there is no need to make
     * a copy as the <code>object</code> has to implement <code>Serializable</code> and a copy
     * is made by the underlying system.  A processor cannot access the memory space of
     * another processor.
