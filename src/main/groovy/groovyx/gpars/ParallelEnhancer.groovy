/**
 * ParallelEnhancer allows classes or instances to be enhanced with parallel variants of iterative methods,
 * like eachParallel(), collectParallel(), findAllParallel() and others. These operations split processing into multiple
 * concurrently executable tasks and perform them on the underlying instance of the ForkJoinPool class from JSR-166y.
 * The pool itself is stored in a final property threadPool and can be managed through static methods
 * on the ParallelEnhancer class.
 * All enhanced classes and instances will share the underlying pool. Use the getThreadPool() method to get hold of the thread pool.
