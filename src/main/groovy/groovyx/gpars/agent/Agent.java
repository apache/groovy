/**
 * A special-purpose thread-safe non-blocking reference implementation inspired by Agents in Clojure.
 * Agents safe-guard mutable values by allowing only a single agent-managed thread to make modifications to them.
 * The mutable values are not directly accessible from outside, but instead requests have to be sent to the agent
 * and the agent guarantees to process the requests sequentially on behalf of the callers. Agents guarantee sequential
 * execution of all requests and so consistency of the values.
 * An agent wraps a reference to mutable state, held inside a single field, and accepts code (closures / commands)
 * as messages, which can be sent to the Agent just like to any other actor using the '&lt;&lt;' operator
 * or any of the send() methods.
 * After reception of a closure / command, the closure is invoked against the internal mutable field. The closure is guaranteed
 * to be run without intervention from other threads and so may freely alter the internal state of the Agent
 * held in the internal <i>data</i> field.
 * The return value of the submitted closure is sent in reply to the sender of the closure.
 * If the message sent to an agent is not a closure, it is considered to be a new value for the internal
 * reference field. The internal reference can also be changed using the updateValue() method from within the received
 * closures.
 * The 'val' property of an agent will safely return the current value of the Agent, while the valAsync() method
 * will do the same without blocking the caller.
 * The 'instantVal' property will retrieve the current value of the Agent without having to wait in the queue of tasks.
 * The initial internal value can be passed to the constructor. The two-parameter constructor allows to alter the way
 * the internal value is returned from val/valAsync. By default the original reference is returned, but in many scenarios a copy
 * or a clone might be more appropriate.
