 * def actor = actor {

 * }.start()

 * actor.send 'Hi!'
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * All actors created through the Actors class will belong to the same default actor group and run
 * on daemon threads.
 * The DefaultPGroup class should be used when actors need to be grouped into multiple groups or when non-daemon
 * threads are to be used.
