/**
 * The DefaultActor class is the base for all stateful actors, who need to maintain implicit state between subsequent message arrivals.
 * Allowing the actor creator to structure code in a continuation-like style with message retrieval react commands mixed within normal code
 * makes implementation of some algorithms particularly easy.
 * <p>
 * The DefaultActor upon start-up will grab a thread from the associated actor thread pool and run its body.
 * The body is either the parameter passed to the constructor, or the act() method, if no parameter has been set.
 * The parameter takes precedence over the act() method.
 * Once a react() method call is discovered within the actor's body, its Closure-typed parameter will be scheduled for processing on next message arrival.
 * To preserve the actor principle of at-most-one active thread per actor, the next message, however, will only be handled once the currently run code finishes and frees the current thread.
 * It is thus advisable to avoid code after call to react().
 * The loop() method will ensure its body is executed repeatedly, until the actor either finishes or an optional loop condition is not met.
 * </p>
