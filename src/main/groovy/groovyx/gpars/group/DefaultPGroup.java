/**
 * Provides logical grouping for actors, agents and dataflow tasks and operators. Each group has an
 * underlying thread pool, which will perform actions on behalf of the users belonging to the group. {@code
 * Actors} created through the {@code DefaultPGroup.actor} method will automatically belong to the group
 * through which they were created, just like agents created through the {@code agent} or {@code fairAgent}
 * methods or dataflow tasks and operators created through the {@code task} or {@code operator} methods.
 * Uses a pool of non-daemon threads.  The {@code DefaultPGroup} class implements the {@code Pool} interface
 * through {@code @Delegate}.
 * <pre>
 * def group = new DefaultPGroup()
 * group.resize 1
 * def actor = group.actor {
 *   react { message -&gt;
 *     println message
 *   }
 * }.start()
 * actor.send 'Hi!'
 * . . .
 * group.shutdown()
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Otherwise, if constructing {@code Actors} directly through their constructors, the {@code
 * AbstractPooledActor.parallelGroup} property, which defaults to the {@code Actors.defaultActorPGroup}, can
 * be set before the actor is started.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * def group = new DefaultPGroup()
 * def actor = new MyActor()
 * actor.parallelGroup = group
 * actor.start()
 * . . .
 * group.shutdown()
