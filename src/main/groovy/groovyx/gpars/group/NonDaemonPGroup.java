/**
 * Provides logical grouping for actors, agents and dataflow tasks and operators. Each group has an underlying thread pool, which will perform actions
 * on behalf of the users belonging to the group. Actors created through the DefaultPGroup.actor() method
 * will automatically belong to the group through which they were created, just like agents created through the agent() or fairAgent() methods
 * or dataflow tasks and operators created through the task() or operator() methods.
 * Uses a pool of non-daemon threads.
 * The DefaultPGroup class implements the Pool interface through @Delegate.
