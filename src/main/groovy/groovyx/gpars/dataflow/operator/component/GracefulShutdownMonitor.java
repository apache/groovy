/**
 * The monitor will orchestrate a graceful shutdown, when its shutdownNetwork() method is called.
 * For this mechanism to work, all selectors/operators in the network have to have their own instance of GracefulShutdownListener added
 * and these listeners have to share the same GracefulShutdownMonitor instance.
 * Each listener observes the activity in the input channels of its corresponding operator/selector. Upon graceful shutdown
 * initialization, the listeners also start watching the state of their operators/selectors.
 * The GracefulShutdownMonitor then repeatedly watches, whether listeners report activity in the operators.
 * When the activity ceases, the monitor will poll all listeners about the state of their operator/selector and its input channels.
 * If all listeners report no activity and no incoming messages, the monitor can safely terminate all operators.
