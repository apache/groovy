/**
 * A Select allows the user to select a value from multiple channels, which have a value available for read at the moment.
 * It can either pick a channel randomly, when using the plain select method, or with precedence towards channels with lower position indexes,
 * when the prioritySelect method is used.
 * If a value is not available immediately in any of the channels, Select will wait for the first value to arrive in any of the channels.
 * <p>
 * Both 'select' and 'prioritySelect' methods come in two flavours - blocking, which wait till a value is available in a channel,
 * and messaging, which send out a message to the specified message handler, as soon as a message is available.
 * Optionally, all methods allow the user to specify a boolean mask, assigning each select 's input channel a flag indicating,
 * whether it should be included in the select operation. This is useful when handling state to selectively block some inputs
 * in some states.
 * </p>
