= Getting started

== Download

From the https://groovy.apache.org/download.html[download] page,
you will be able to download the distribution (binary and source),
the Windows installer (a community artifact) and the documentation for **Groovy**.

For a quick and effortless start on Mac OSX, Linux, WSL2 or Cygwin, you can use https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!]
(The Software Development Kit Manager) to download and configure any **Groovy** version of your choice.
Basic <<SDKMAN,instructions>> can be found below.

=== Stable

- **Download zip**: https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-zips/apache-groovy-binary-{groovy-full-version}.zip[**Binary Release**] | https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-zips/apache-groovy-src-{groovy-full-version}.zip[Source Release]
- **Download documentation**: https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-zips/apache-groovy-docs-{groovy-full-version}.zip[**JavaDoc and zipped online documentation**]
- **Combined binary / source / documentation bundle**: https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-zips/apache-groovy-sdk-{groovy-full-version}.zip[**Distribution bundle**]

You can learn more about this version in the https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-{groovy-short-version}.html[release notes] or in the https://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-{groovy-full-version}.html[changelog].

If you plan on using invokedynamic support, link:invokedynamic-support.html[read those notes].

=== Snapshots

For those who want to test the very latest versions of Groovy and live on the bleeding edge, you can use our https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/groovy[snapshot builds].
As soon as a build succeeds on our continuous integration server a snapshot is deployed to this repository.
These snapshots are not official releases and are intended for integration testing by the development
community prior to official versions being released. We welcome any feedback.

=== Prerequisites

Groovy {groovy-short-version} requires Java 8+ with support for up to Java 16.

Various Groovy CI servers run the test suite (with more than 10000 tests) across numerous versions of Java.
Those servers are also useful to look at to confirm supported Java versions for different Groovy releases.

== Maven Repository

If you wish to embed Groovy in your application, you may just prefer to point your build
to your favourite maven repository or the Groovy https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release-local/[artifactory instance].
Please see the https://groovy.apache.org/download.html#buildtools[download page] for available modules for each Groovy version.

[[SDKMAN]]
== SDKMAN! (The Software Development Kit Manager)

This tool makes installing Groovy on any Bash platform (Mac OSX, Linux, Cygwin, Solaris or FreeBSD) very easy.

Simply open a new terminal and enter:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
----

Follow the instructions on-screen to complete installation.

Open a new terminal or type the command:

[source,shell]
----
$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
----

Then install the latest stable Groovy:

[source,shell]
----
$ sdk install groovy
----

After installation is complete and you've made it your default version, test it with:

[source,shell]
----
$ groovy -version
----

That's all there is to it!

== Other ways to get Groovy

=== Installation on Mac OS X

==== MacPorts

If you're on macOS and have https://www.macports.org[MacPorts] installed, you can run:

[source,shell]
----
sudo port install groovy
----

==== Homebrew

If you're on macOS and have https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] installed, you can run:

[source,shell]
----
brew install groovy
----

=== Installation on Windows

If you're on Windows, you can also use the https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-windows-installer/[Windows installer].

=== Other Distributions

You may download other distributions of Groovy from the ASF
https://archive.apache.org/dist/groovy/[archive repository]
or from the Groovy
https://groovy.jfrog.io/artifactory/dist-release-local/groovy-zips/[artifactory instance] (also includes pre-ASF versions).

=== Source Code

If you prefer to live on the bleeding edge, you can also grab the https://github.com/apache/groovy[source code from GitHub].

=== IDE plugin

If you are an IDE user, you can just grab the latest link:tools-ide.html[IDE plugin] and follow the plugin installation instructions.

== Install Binary

These instructions describe how to install a binary distribution of **Groovy**:

* https://groovy.apache.org/download.html[Download] a binary distribution of Groovy and unpack it into some folder on your local file system.
* Set your `GROOVY_HOME` environment variable to the directory where you unpacked the distribution.
* Add `GROOVY_HOME/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.
* Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK. On OS X this is `/Library/Java/Home`, on other unixes its often `/usr/java` etc. If you've already installed tools like Ant or Maven you've probably already done this step.

You should now have Groovy installed properly. You can test this by typing the following in a command shell:

[source,shell]
----
groovysh
----

Which should create an interactive groovy shell where you can type Groovy statements. Or to run the <<{groovy-console}#title-heading,Swing interactive console>> type:

[source,shell]
----
groovyConsole
----

To run a specific Groovy script type:

[source,shell]
----
groovy SomeScript
----
