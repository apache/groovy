/**
 * StatementWriter.writeTryCatchFinally visits the finally block
 * twice, once for the normal path and once again for the "catch all"
 * path. When the OptimizingStatementWriter is used DeclarationExpressions
 * are rewritten to BinaryExpressions to allow splitting between fast and
 * slow paths.  Because the expression is modified variable declarations
 * are lost if the statement is visited more than once.
 *
 * This is not a problem for scripts because the property call that is
 * generated will succeed because of the script context.  So to reproduce
 * the issue it must be contained in a class.
