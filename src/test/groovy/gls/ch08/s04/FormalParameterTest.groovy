     * Chapter 8:    Classes
     * Section 8.4:  Method Declarations
     * Author:       Ken Barclay
     *
     * File:         arity.method.declaration.classes.8.4.groovy
     *
     * A class declaration may include any number of method declarations including
     *   abstract method declarations.
     *
     * A method is given a name and an optional list of formal parameter declarations
     *   enclosed in parentheses ( and ). A parameter declaration at its simplest is
     *   simply a parameter name. It may be prefixed with a combination of optional
     *   parameter modifiers (def or final), a type, or a type followed by the varargs
     *   symbol (...). Two formal parameters with the same name is disallowed.
     *
     * A formal parameter may be optionally initialized with an expression, referred
     *   to as a default parameter. If the number of actual parameters is fewer than
     *   the number of formal parameters, then each actual is used to initialize, in
     *   order, the non-default formal parameters. When all the actual parameters are
     *   used in this manner, all subsequent formal parameters require default values.
     *
     * If the last formal parameter is a variable arity parameter, it is considered
     *   to define a method that is referred to as a variable arity method. Invocations
     *   of a variable arity method may contain more actual argument expressions than
     *   formal parameters. All the actual argument expressions that do not correspond
     *   to the formal parameters preceding the variable arity parameter will be evaluated
     *   and the results stored into an array that will be passed to the method invocation.
