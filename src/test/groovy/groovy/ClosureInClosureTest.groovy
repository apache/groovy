/**
 * Bug illustrating the nested closures variable scope visibility issue.
 * l.each is ClosureInClosureBug$1 and it.each is ClosureInClosureBug$2
 * The variable text is not visible from ClosureInClosureBug$2.
 * Indeed, a closure can only see the variable defined outside this closure (one level up)
 * but cannot see what's in the second level.
 *
 * In order to make the test work, do not forget to uncomment the line "println(text)"
