= The <groovyc> Ant Task

[[groovyc-ant-task-using]]
== `<groovyc>`

[[groovyc-ant-task-description]]
=== Description

Compiles Groovy source files and, if joint compilation option is used, Java source files from http://ant.apache.org/[Apache Ant].

[[groovyc-ant-task-taskdef]]
=== Required taskdef

Assuming the groovy jars are in _groovy.libs_, you will need to declare this task
at some point in the `build.xml` prior to the `groovyc` task being invoked.
Consider also adding any additional Groovy module jars, libraries and potentially transitive dependencies you might be using.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<taskdef name="groovyc" classname="org.codehaus.groovy.ant.Groovyc">
  <classpath>
    <fileset file="${groovy.libs}/groovy-ant-VERSION.jar"/>
    <fileset file="${groovy.libs}/groovy-VERSION.jar"/>
  </classpath>
</taskdef>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[groovyc-ant-task-attributes]]
=== <groovyc> Attributes

[cols="<,<,<",options="header,footer"]
|=======================================================================
|Attribute |Description |Required

|srcdir |Location of the Groovy (and possibly Java) source files. |Yes

|destdir |Location to store the class files. |Yes

|classpath |The classpath to use. |No

|classpathref |The classpath to use given as a path references. |No

|sourcepath |The sourcepath to use. |No

|sourcepathref |The sourcepath to use given as a path reference. |No

|encoding |Encoding of source files. |No

|verbose |Asks the compiler for verbose output; defaults to no. |No

|includeAntRuntime |Whether to include the Ant run-time libraries in the
classpath; defaults to yes. |No

|includeJavaRuntime |Whether to include the default run-time libraries
from the executing VM in the classpath; defaults to no. |No

|includeDestClasses |This property controls whether to include the destination
classes directory in the classpath given to the compiler. The default value is "true". |No

|fork |Whether to execute groovyc using a spawned instance of the JVM;
defaults to no. |No

|memoryInitialSize |The initial size of the memory for the underlying
VM, if using fork mode; ignored otherwise. Defaults to the standard VM
memory setting. (Examples: 83886080, 81920k, or 80m) |No

|memoryMaximumSize |The maximum size of the memory for the underlying
VM, if using fork mode; ignored otherwise. Defaults to the standard VM
memory setting. (Examples: 83886080, 81920k, or 80m) |No

|failonerror |Indicates whether compilation errors will fail the build;
defaults to true. |No

|proceed |Inverse alias for _failonerror_. |No

|listfiles |Indicates whether the source files to be compiled will be
listed; defaults to no. |No

|stacktrace |if true each compile error message will contain a
stacktrace |No

|indy |Enable compilation with the ``invoke dynamic'' support when using
Groovy 2.0 and beyond and running on JDK 7 |No

|scriptBaseClass |Sets the base class for Groovy scripts |No

|stubdir |Set the stub directory into which the Java source stub files should be generated.
The directory need not exist and will not be deleted automatically - though its contents
will be cleared unless 'keepStubs' is true. Ignored when forked. |No

|keepStubs |Set the keepStubs flag. Defaults to false. Set to true for debugging.
Ignored when forked. |No

|forceLookupUnnamedFiles |The Groovyc Ant task is frequently used in the context of a build system
that knows the complete list of source files to be compiled. In such a
context, it is wasteful for the Groovy compiler to go searching the
classpath when looking for source files and hence by default the
Groovyc Ant task calls the compiler in a special mode with such searching
turned off. If you wish the compiler to search for source files then
you need to set this flag to true. Defaults to false. |No

|configscript |Set the configuration file used to customize the compilation configuration. |No

|parameters |Generates metadata for reflection on method parameter names on JDK 8 and above.
Defaults to false. |No

|previewFeatures |Enables the JEP preview features on JDK 12 and above.
Defaults to false. |No

|targetBytecode |Sets the bytecode compatibility level. |No

|javahome |Sets the `java.home` value to use, default is the current JDK's home. |No

|executable |Sets the name of the java executable to use when invoking the compiler in forked mode,
ignored otherwise. |No

|scriptExtension |Set the extension to use when searching for Groovy source files.
Accepts extensions in the form *.groovy, .groovy or groovy. |No

|updatedProperty |The property to set on compilation success. This property will not be set if
the compilation fails, or if there are no files to compile. |No

|errorProperty |The property to set on compilation failure. This property will be set if
the compilation fails. |No

|=======================================================================

*Example:*

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<path id="classpath.main">
  <fileset dir="${groovy.libs}" includes="*.jar" excludes="groovy-ant-*.jar"/>
  ...
</path>
<groovyc srcdir="${dir.sources}" destdir="${dir.classes}" classpathref="classpath.main"
         fork="true" includeantruntime="false" configscript="config.groovy" targetBytecode="1.8"/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[[groovyc-ant-task-nested-elements]]
=== <groovyc> Nested Elements

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header,footer"]
|==========================================================
|element |kind |Required |Replaces Attribute
|src |a path structure |Yes (unless srcdir is used) |srcdir
|classpath |a path structure |No |classpath or classpathref
|javac |javac task |No |N/A
|==========================================================

*Notes:*

* For path structures see for example
https://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html#path
* For usages of the `javac` task see
https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/javac.html
* The nested `javac` task behaves more or less as documented for the top-level
`javac` task. `srcdir`, `destdir`, `fork`, `memoryInitialSize`, and `memoryMaximumSize`
for the nested `javac` task are taken from the enclosing `groovyc` task.
If these attributes or any else that are not explicitly supported are specified then a
warning is logged, and they are ignored completely.
`classpath` and `classpathref` specified on the nested `javac` task is merged with
the values taken from the enclosing `groovyc` task and also used for the Groovy compilation.
Nested inside the nested `javac` task the only element supported is `compilerarg`,
and this only with the `value` attribute, which is treated like the `line` attribute of the
top-level `javac` task, i.e. it is split by spaces into separate arguments.
Only arguments starting with `-W`, `-X`, or `-proc:` are properly translated as needed.
Anything else is supplied as-is to groovyc and has to be manually prefixed with `-F` or `-J`.

[[groovyc-ant-task-joint-compilation]]
=== Joint Compilation

Joint compilation is enabled by using an embedded `javac` element, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<groovyc srcdir="${testSourceDirectory}" destdir="${testClassesDirectory}" targetBytecode="1.8">
  <classpath>
    <pathelement path="${mainClassesDirectory}"/>
    <pathelement path="${testClassesDirectory}"/>
    <path refid="testPath"/>
  </classpath>
  <javac debug="true" source="1.8" target="1.8" />
</groovyc>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

More details about joint compilation can be found in the <<{tools-groovyc}#section-jointcompilation,joint compilation>> section.
