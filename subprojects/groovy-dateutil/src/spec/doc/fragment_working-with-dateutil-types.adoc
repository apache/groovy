= Working with legacy Date/Calendar types

The `groovy-dateutil` module supports numerous extensions for working with
Java's classic `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

You can access the properties of a `Date` or `Calendar` using the normal array index notation
with the constant field numbers from the `Calendar` class as shown in the following example:

[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------
include::{rootprojectdir}/subprojects/groovy-dateutil/src/spec/test/gdk/WorkingWithDateUtilTypesTest.groovy[tags=calendar_getAt,indent=0]
-------------------------------------
<1> Import the constants
<2> Setting the calendar's year, month and day of month
<3> Accessing the calendar's day of week

Groovy supports arithmetic on and iteration between `Date` and `Calendar` instances as shown in the following example:
[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------
include::{rootprojectdir}/subprojects/groovy-dateutil/src/spec/test/gdk/WorkingWithDateUtilTypesTest.groovy[tags=date_arithmetic,indent=0]
-------------------------------------

You can parse strings into dates and output dates into formatted strings:
[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------
include::{rootprojectdir}/subprojects/groovy-dateutil/src/spec/test/gdk/WorkingWithDateUtilTypesTest.groovy[tags=date_parsing,indent=0]
-------------------------------------

You can also create a new Date or Calendar based on an existing one:
[source,groovy]
-------------------------------------
include::{rootprojectdir}/subprojects/groovy-dateutil/src/spec/test/gdk/WorkingWithDateUtilTypesTest.groovy[tags=date_copyWith,indent=0]
-------------------------------------
