= Groovysh, the Groovy shell

== Groovy : Groovy Shell

NOTE: The groovysh is undergoing a major re-vamp and some of this information may not yet have been updated to reflect the latest changes.

The Groovy Shell, aka. `groovysh` is a command-line application which
allows easy access to evaluate Groovy expressions, define classes and
run simple experiments.

[[GroovyShell-Features]]
=== Features

* Rich cross-platform line editing, history and completion thanks
to https://github.com/jline/jline3[JLine3].
* ANSI colors (prompt, exception traces, etc).
* Simple, yet robust, command system with online help, user alias
support and more.

[[GroovyShell-Command-lineOptionsandArguments]]
=== Command-line Options and Arguments

The shell supports several options to control various features.

[[GroovyShell-Model]]
=== Repl model

The Groovy Shell is a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) which allows you to
interactively evaluate Groovy expressions and statements,
define classes and other types, invoke commands, and run simple experiments.

When you input a line, the shell will try to determine if the input you
have given is a complete valid expression, statement, or definition.
If not complete, it will prompt you for more input.
If it is complete, it will execute the input, and print the result,
if any, to the console. Each input you enter is executed in isolation.

There are some exceptions to this conceptual model. Any import statements
entered will be remembered and used for all subsequent evaluations.
Similarly, with some caveats we'll discuss next, any previously defined classes, methods, and potentially variables will be available.

The shell has the concept of shared variables. Given that subsequent statements
are run in isolation, you should store any results needed for later use in shared variables.

Many Groovy tutorials and examples use the `def` keyword or a type to define variables.
Script examples might distinguish between local variables with a type and script
binding variables where no type, nor the `def` or `var` type placeholders,
are given. The script binding is the exact equivalent to the shell's shared variables.

Because such statements are so common, the shell has a special mode
called _interpreter mode_ which allows you to use typed variables.
The following table summarizes the differences between the two modes:

[options="header"]
|===
| interpreterMode | off | on
| imports 2+| remembered
| types 2+| available
| methods | converted to closure shared variables | remembered
| shared variables 2+| available
| local variables | forgotten | remembered
|===

Conceptually, for things that are _remembered_ in the above table,
it is as if you included the related code at the start of each of your inputs.

The shell also has the concept of the "current buffer". This is the collection of all type,
method, imports, and variable definitions. The ordering of these snippets is retained,
which is important for the shell, since it is only executing one snippet at a time,
it typically requires everything needed for a snippet to be pre-defined.
This is different to a compiler which might compile multiple source files at once,
and resolve references between types as needed.

[[GroovyShell-EvaluatingExpressions]]
=== Evaluating Expressions

[[GroovyShell-SimpleExpressions]]
==== Simple Expressions

[source,jshell]
---------------
groovy> println "Hello"
Hello
---------------

[[GroovyShell-EvaluationResult]]
==== Evaluation Result

When a complete expression is found, it is compiled and evaluated. The
result of the evaluation is stored into the `_` variable.

[[GroovyShell-Multi-lineExpressions]]
==== Multi-line Expressions

Multi-line/complex expressions (like closure or class definitions) may
be defined over several lines. When the shell detects that it has a
complete expression it will compile and evaluate it.

[[GroovyShell-DefineTypes]]
==== Defining types

You can define all the normal types, e.g. a class:

[source,jshell]
---------------------
groovy> class Foo {
add: } >   def bar() {
add: }}>     println "baz"
add: }}>   }
add: } > }
---------------------

And use it in the normal way.

[source,jshell]
---------------
groovy> foo = new Foo()
groovy> foo.bar()
baz
---------------

Defined classes are known to the shell and can be used in completion:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_typedef.png[Define Class, width=50%]

[[GroovyShell-Variables]]
==== Variables

Shell variables are *all* untyped (i.e. no `def` or other type information).

This *will* set a shell variable:

[source,groovy]
-----------
foo = "bar"
-----------

But, this will evaluate a local variable and will *not* be saved to the shell’s environment:

[source,groovy]
---------------
def foo = "bar"
---------------

This behavior can be changed by activating <<GroovyShell-InterpreterMode,interpreter mode>>.

Variables definitions having the same name as existing definitions will replace the old definition with the new one.

[[GroovyShell-Methods]]
==== Methods

Methods can be defined in the shell, and will be saved for later use.

Defining a method is easy:

[source,jshell]
----------------------------------
groovy> def hello(name) {
add: }>   println("Hello $name")
add: }> }
----------------------------------

And then using it is as one might expect:

[source,jshell]
--------------
groovy> hello "Jason"
Hello Jason
--------------

If a method definition has the same signature as an existing definition,
the old definition will be replaced with the new one.

When in _interpreterMode_, methods are remembered and given as extra statements
when executing the next input.

When not in _interpreterMode_, the shell internally creates a closure to encapsulate
the method and stores it in the shared variables.
In this case, variables and methods share the same namespace.

[[GroovyShell-Exceptions]]
==== Exceptions

If an exception is thrown, the shell will print the exception message
and set a special `exception` shared variable.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_exceptions.png[Exception, width=80%]

[[GroovyShell-Commands]]
=== Commands

The shell has a number of different commands, which provide rich access
to the shell’s environment.

Commands all have a _name_, e.g. `/help` and `/prnt`.
Commands may also have some predefined system _aliases_, e.g. `/h`.
Users may also create their own aliases. This section will list commands in
alphabetical order, but you can also use the `/help` command to list
the available commands:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
groovy> /help
    /!           execute shell command
    /alias       create command alias
    /cat         concatenate and print FILES
    /cd          change directory
    /classloader display/manage Groovy classLoader data
    /clear       clear terminal
    /colors      view 256-color table and ANSI-styles
    /console     launch Groovy console
    /date        display date
    /del         delete console variables, methods, classes and imports
    /doc         open document on browser
    /echo        echos a value
    /exit        exit from app/script
    /grab        add maven repository dependencies to classpath
    /grep        search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.
    /head        display first lines of files
    /help        command help
    /highlighter manage nanorc theme system
    /history     list history of commands
    /imports     show/delete import statements
    /inspect     display/browse object info on terminal/object browser
    /keymap      manipulate keymaps
    /less        file pager
    /load        load state/a file into the buffer
    /ls          list files
    /methods     show/delete methods
    /nano        edit files
    /pipe        create/delete pipe operator
    /prnt        print object
    /pwd         print working directory
    /reset       clear the buffer
    /save        save state/the buffer to a file
    /setopt      set options
    /setvar      set lineReader variable value
    /show        list console variables
    /slurp       slurp file or string variable context to object
    /sort        writes sorted standard input to standard output.
    /tail        display last lines of files
    /ttop        display and update sorted information about threads
    /types       show/delete types
    /unalias     remove command alias
    /unsetopt    unset options
    /vars        show/delete variable declarations
    /wc          word, line, character, and byte count
    /widget      manipulate widgets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While in the interactive shell, you can ask for help for any command to
get more details about its syntax or function. You can use `/help <command>`
or `<command> --help`. Here is an example of
what happens when you ask for help for the `/help` command:

------------------------------------------------------------
groovy> /help /help
help -  command help
Usage: help [TOPIC...]
  -? --help                      Displays command help
     --groups                    Commands are grouped by registries
  -i --info                      List commands with a short command info
------------------------------------------------------------

[[GroovyShell-alias]]
==== `/alias`

Create an alias for a commandline fragment. The fragment could be Groovy code
or a shell command. When evaluating a commandline, the alias will be replaced
with the fragment:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_alias.png[Usage of /alias, width=75%]

The `/cat` command is already available. As can be seen here, aliases
are replaced before command selection, so with the above alias in place,
we actually invoke `/less -F` command, which has syntax highlighting,
instead of the builtin `/cat` which doesn't.

The fragment is expected to be at the start of a line but other text may follow:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_alias2.png[More /alias examples, width=60%]

Aliases are persisted in a `.groovysh/aliases.json` file in the user home directory.

See also the `/unalias` command, which allows aliases to be removed.

[[GroovyShell-cat]]
==== `/cat`

Concatenate and print files:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /cat answers.json answers.toml
{
    "answer": {
        "universe":
        42
    }
}
[answer]
universe = 42
----

See also the `/less` command, which can be used to display the contents of a file
a page at a time with syntax highlighting.

[[GroovyShell-cd]]
==== `/cd`

Change the current working directory. `groovysh` keeps track of a _current working directory_. You can view it with `/pwd` and change it with `/cd`.

The `groovysh` file commands
(`/cat`, `/less`, `/head`, `/slurp`, `/load`, `/ls`, etc.) will use the current working directory.

NOTE: The JVM running `groovysh` also has its own concept of the current working directory, which is the directory in which `groovysh` was started, so `/!ls` and `/ls` may not show the same files. Using `/!cd` only changes the working directory within the context of that one shell command.

There is a predefined shared variable `PWD` which can assist with invoking shell commands. So, on unix platforms, `/ls` will list the same files as `/!ls $PWD`.

See also the `/pwd` command, which prints the current working directory.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_cd.png[Cd, width=80%]

[[GroovyShell-classloader]]
==== `/classloader`

Display and manage the Groovy classloader data.

Let's `/grab` a dependency, define a class using it, and then use the `/classloader` command to see the classloader data:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_classloader.png[Classloader, width=80%]

[[GroovyShell-clear]]
==== `/clear`

Clears the screen.

[[GroovyShell-colors]]
==== `/colors`

Displays the available colors.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_colors.png[Colors, width=80%]

This can be useful when configuring the console options, for example the `PRNT_COLORS`:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_colors2.png[Colors for /prnt, width=90%]

As this example shows, you can mix color names (like _black_ and _magenta_), theme colors (like _NUMBER_), and color numbers (like _75_).

Here is an example for `HELP_COLORS`:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_colors3.png[Colors for --help, width=75%]

Here is an example for `LS_COLORS`:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_colors4.png[Colors for --help, width=75%]

See the https://github.com/jline/jline3/wiki/REPL-Console-Customization[REPL Console Customization]
documentation for more details about such customization.

[[GroovyShell-console]]
==== `/console`

Displays the current buffer in the GroovyConsole.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_console.png[Console, width=80%]

[[GroovyShell-date]]
==== `/date`

Groovy has numerous classes for working with dates and time.

Here are some examples using the legacy date/calendar classes:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> println new Date()
Tue Aug 19 14:35:22 AEST 2025
groovy> printf '%1ta %1$tb %1$td %1$tT %1$tZ %1$tY%n', new Date()
Tue Aug 19 14:35:22 AEST 2025
groovy> println Calendar.instance.time
Tue Aug 19 14:35:22 AEST 2025
groovy> println new Date().format('dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm')
19-Aug-2025 14:35
----

Here are some examples using the `java.time` classes:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> println LocalDateTime.now()
2025-08-19T14:17:35.383665
groovy> println Instant.now()
2025-08-19T04:17:35.590829Z
groovy> printf '%1ta %1$tb %1$td %1$tT %1$tY%n', LocalDateTime.now()
Tue Aug 19 14:47:35 2025
groovy> println LocalDateTime.now().format('dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm')
19-Aug-2025 14:47
----

The `/date` command is an alternative for those familiar with the unix `date` commandL:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /date -R
Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:17:05 +10
groovy> /date --rfc-3339=seconds
2025-08-19 14:17:05+10
groovy> /date --rfc-3339=time
Aug Tue 19 14:17:05 2025
----

[[GroovyShell-del]]
==== `/del`

Deletes objects from the shell. The command looks for any
variable, method, type, shared data, or import with the given name and deletes it.

Here we create two variables, `x` and `y`, then delete the `x` variable:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_del.png[Console, width=40%]

See also, the `/vars`, `/methods`, `/types`, and `/imports` commands.
These offer a `-d`|`--delete` option to delete the respective objects
with completion.

[[GroovyShell-doc]]
==== `/doc`

Open documentation in a browser.

For example, we can get both the Javadoc and GDK enhancements doc for `java.util.List` (shown running on JDK17):

[subs=attributes]
----
groovy:000> :doc java.util.List
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/groovy-jdk/java/util/List.html
----

This will print the documentation URLs found and open two windows (or tabs, depending on your browser):

* one for the JDK documentation
* one for the GDK documentation

By default, for Java classes, the `java.base` module is assumed. You can specify an optional module
for other cases (shown running on JDK17):

----
groovy:000> :doc java.scripting javax.script.ScriptContext
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.scripting/javax/script/ScriptContext.html
----

For backwards compatibility, if no module is specified when searching for Java classes, and no class is found in the `java.base` module, an additional attempt is made to find documentation for the class in the JDK8 (pre-module) Javadoc:

----
groovy:000> :doc javax.script.ScriptContext
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptContext.html
----

To get the Groovydoc for `groovy.ant.AntBuilder` and `groovy.xml.XmlSlurper`:

[subs=attributes]
----
groovy:000> :doc groovy.ant.AntBuilder
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/gapi/groovy/ant/AntBuilder.html
groovy:000> :doc groovy.xml.XmlSlurper
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/gapi/groovy/xml/XmlSlurper.html
----

To get both the Groovydoc and GDK enhancements doc for `groovy.lang.Closure` and `groovy.sql.GroovyResultSet`:

[subs=attributes]
----
groovy:000> :doc groovy.lang.Closure
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/gapi/groovy/lang/Closure.html
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/groovy-jdk/groovy/lang/Closure.html
groovy:000> :doc groovy.sql.GroovyResultSet
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/gapi/groovy/sql/GroovyResultSet.html
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/groovy-jdk/groovy/sql/GroovyResultSet.html
----

Documentation is also available for the GDK enhancements to primitive arrays and arrays of arrays:

[subs=attributes]
----
groovy:000> :doc int[]
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/groovy-jdk/primitives-and-primitive-arrays/int%5B%5D.html
groovy:000> :doc double[][]
https://docs.groovy-lang.org/{groovy-full-version}/html/groovy-jdk/primitives-and-primitive-arrays/double%5B%5D%5B%5D.html
----

NOTE: In contexts where opening a browser may not be desirable, e.g. on a CI server,
this command can be disabled by setting the `groovysh.disableDocCommand` system property to `true`.

[[GroovyShell-echo]]
==== `/echo`

The `/echo` command outputs its arguments to the console. Arguments are output verbatim,
but variable expansion is also supported.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_echo.png[Echo, width=60%]

See also the `/prnt` command, which is similar but may perform additional formatting
on the output(s).

[[GroovyShell-exit]]
==== `/exit`

Exit the shell.

This is the *only* way to exit the shell. Well, you can still `CTRL-Z` on unix platforms,
but things like `CTRL_C` are trapped. (See JLine3 documentation for more details.)

[[GroovyShell-grab]]
==== `/grab`

Grab a dependency (Maven, Ivy, etc.) from Internet sources or cache,
and add it to the Groovy Shell environment.

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /grab org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:4.5.0
groovy> import org.apache.commons.collections4.bidimap.TreeBidiMap
groovy> TreeBidiMap t = [apple: 'red']
{apple=red}
groovy> t.inverseBidiMap()
{red=apple}
----

Completion is available. Currently, completion options are populated
by known artifacts in the local Maven (~/.m2) and Grape (~/.groovy/grapes) repositories. In the future, completion from a remote repositories may be supported.

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /grab org.apache.commons:commons-<TAB>
commons-collections4:     commons-dbcp2:            commons-lang3:
commons-compress:         commons-digester3:        commons-math3:
commons-configuration2:   commons-email:            commons-parent:
commons-crypto:           commons-exec:             commons-pool2:
commons-csv:              commons-imaging:          commons-text:
----

This command can be given at any time to add new dependencies.

[[GroovyShell-grep]]
==== `/grep`

The `/grep` command searches for patterns in files or standard input.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_grep.png[Echo, width=60%]

[[GroovyShell-head]]
==== `/head`

The `/head` command displays the start of a file.

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /head -n2 fruit.txt
apple
banana
----

[[GroovyShell-history]]
==== `/history`

Display, manage and recall edit-line history. The `/history` command has numerous options
which let you list (with various options), save, read, and clear the edit-line history.

----
groovy> /history -?
history -  list history of commands
Usage: history [-dnrfEie] [-m match] [first] [last]
       history -ARWI [filename]
       history -s [old=new] [command]
       history --clear
       history --save
  -? --help                      Displays command help
     --clear                     Clear history
     --save                      Save history
  -m match                       If option -m is present the first argument is taken as a pattern
                                 and only the history events matching the pattern will be shown
  -d                             Print timestamps for each event
  -f                             Print full time date stamps in the US format
  -E                             Print full time date stamps in the European format
  -i                             Print full time date stamps in ISO8601 format
  -n                             Suppresses command numbers
  -r                             Reverses the order of the commands
  -A                             Appends the history out to the given file
  -R                             Reads the history from the given file
  -W                             Writes the history out to the given file
  -I                             If added to -R, only the events that are not contained within the internal list are added
                                 If added to -W or -A, only the events that are new since the last incremental operation
                                 to the file are added
  [first] [last]                 These optional arguments may be specified as a number or as a string. A negative number
                                 is used as an offset to the current history event number. A string specifies the most
                                 recent event beginning with the given string.
  -e                             Uses the nano editor to edit the commands before executing
  -s                             Re-executes the command without invoking an editor
----

Here is an example of using the `/history` command:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_history.png[Usage of the /history command, width=70%]

[[GroovyShell-import]]
==== `import`

Add a custom import which will be included for all shell evaluations.

[source,jshell]
--------------
groovy> import java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque
--------------

This command can be given at any time to add new imports.

Completion is available and prompts a level at a time using the package structure of all known classes.

[source,jshell]
--------------

[[GroovyShell-nano]]
==== `/nano`

Edit files or the current buffer.

The `/nano` command has numerous options:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_nano_help.png[Help for the /nano command, width=100%]

You can use the `/nano` command to edit files or the current buffer:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_nano.png[Using the /nano command, width=80%]

If editing the current buffer, when you exit and then save,
the buffer will be reloaded with the edited contents.

[[GroovyShell-pipe]]
==== `/pipe`

The `/pipe` command lets you create and delete custom pipe operators.

There are several builtin pipe and pipe-like operators:

* The _pipe and_ operator (|&&) executes the right hand side only if the execution of the left hand side succeeds
* The _pipe or_ operator (|||) executes the right hand side only if the execution of the left hand side fails
* The _pipe flip_ operator (|;) flips the left and right hand side expressions
* The _output redirect_ operator (|>) redirects the output to a file
* The _append output redirect_ operator (|>>) redirects the output by appending to a file

For the pipe _and_ and _or_ operators, _succeeds_ means executing without
throwing an exception and returning a non-null, non-empty, non-zero result,
i.e. `true` according to _Groovy truth_.

Here are some examples for _and_ and _or_:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_pipe_builtin.png[usage of the builtin pipes, width=50%]

Pipe operators are handled by the shell. The left and right hand sides
will be either repl commands or code passed to the Groovy engine for execution.

The pipe _flip_ operator is most commonly used with commands:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /widget -l |; /prnt -s JSON
[
    "_autosuggest-end-of-line (_autosuggest-end-of-line)",
    "_autosuggest-forward-char (_autosuggest-forward-char)",
    ...
]
----

It is less common, but it can also be used with code:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> 4 |; 8 -
4
groovy> 4 |; 8 *
32
groovy> 4 |; 8 /
2
groovy> 4 |; 8 +
12
groovy> 4 |; 8 %
0
groovy> 4 |; 8 **
4096
----

You can also define your own custom pipe operators, defined using `/pipe [OPERATOR] [PREFIX] [POSTFIX]`,
as these examples show:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_pipe.png[usage of the /pipe command, width=70%]

JLine functionality includes support for _named pipes_ and _pipe aliases_.

Here is a named pipe for finding fruit with small names:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /pipe smallFruit '.findAll{ it.size() <' '}'
groovy> fruit | smallFruit 6
[apple, date]
----

Here is a pipe alias:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /alias sizes '|. it.size()'
groovy> fruit | sizes
[5, 6, 6, 4, 10]
----

The pipe alias always has the pipe it is aliasing at the start, `|.` in the above example.

[NOTE]
--
Care should be taken when using named pipes along with Groovy code that uses Groovy's
pipe operator (`|`), AKA binary OR operator, as this can lead to conflicts.

Is the expression `x | y` the binary OR of two variables, or making use of a named pipe
with name `y`?

Spaces in Groovy are normally not significant, but the Groovy Shell
is using JLine console functionality which requires spaces around the pipe operator
before a named pipe and is bracket aware.
So, `x| y`, `x |y`, `x|y`, and `(x | y)` will be passed to Groovy for execution.
The Groovy Shell also passes `x | y` to Groovy if `y` is not a known named pipe.

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> x = 4
groovy> y = 8
groovy> x | y
12
groovy> /pipe y '+1' ''
groovy> x | y
5
----

Getting back to how you can avoid conflicts,
one convention you could use to avoid conflicts is to use brackets or avoid spaces
when wanting the binary OR operator,
and use spaces and no brackets when wanting to use a named pipe.

Another alternative, is to define a custom pipe name instead of a named pipe:

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /pipe |smallFruit '.findAll{ it.size() <' '}'
groovy> fruit |smallFruit 6
[apple, date, fig, grape]
groovy> /pipe
smallFruit  [.findAll{ it.size() <, }]
|smallFruit [.findAll{ it.size() <, }]
----

Here, the custom pipe named `|smallFruit`, is different to the named pipe `smallFruit`.
The former mustn't have a space, the latter must have one.
If you use only the first of these, you can have a convention of
using spaces when you want a binary OR.
--

As a final example, let's use a custom pipe with the output redirection
operators to find fruit with large names:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_pipe2.png[usage of the /pipe command, width=80%]

[[GroovyShell-prnt]]
==== `/prnt`

The `/prnt` command outputs its argument to the console. Both variable expansion
and formatting are supported.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_prnt.png[usage of the /prnt command, width=60%]

See also the `/echo` command, which is similar but takes multiple arguments.
It also supports variable expansion but doesn't support formatting.

[[GroovyShell-pwd]]
==== `/pwd`

The `/pwd` command prints the current working directory.

[source,jshell]
----
groovy> /pwd
/Users/paulk/Projects/groovy
----

[[GroovyShell-reset]]
==== `/reset`

Clears the current buffer and shared variables.

[[GroovyShell-save]]
==== `/save`

Saves the buffer’s contents to a file.

If no filename is given as an argument, the current shared variables are
saved into the `.groovy/groovysh.ser` file in the user home directory.

[[GroovyShell-setopt]]
==== `/setopt`

Set options.

----
groovy> /setopt -?
setopt -  set options
Usage: setopt [-m] option ...
setopt
-? --help                      Displays command help

[[GroovyShell-show]]
==== `/show`

Show the shared variables (the binding). These include your shared variables
as well as a few used for configuring various shell features.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_show.png[Usage of the /show command, width=60%]

[[GroovyShell-slurp]]
==== `/slurp`

Slurp files to shared variables. Groovy has a bunch of slurpers for
various formats like XML, JSON, YAML, etc. You can use those in your code
if you like, but the `/slurp` command can be a convenience shortcut.
It supports most of the common formats, including JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, TOML and property files.

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/repl_slurp.png[Usage of the /slurp command, width=75%]

As you can see in the usage information at the end of the above image,
you can also provide an encoding and a format. If no format is given,
`UTF_8` is the default. If no format is given, the shell will try to
determine the format from the extension of the file (if given).

Although the details of the exact object returned are an implementation
detail which may change in the future, the current behavior is as follows:

[cols="1,5" options="header"]
|===
| Format | Notes
| JSON | Uses JsonSlurper, returns a lazy Map.
| TOML | Uses TomlSlurper, returns a lazy Map.
| YAML | Uses YamlSlurper, returns a lazy Map.
| XML | Uses XmlParser, returns a Node.
| PROPERTIES | Returns a Properties file, which is a Map-like object.
| CSV | Uses Apache Commons CSV if on the classpath. Assumes a header row which is used to
create a list (the rows) of maps from column name to value.
| TEXT | Reads the file as raw lines (or argument as a line).
| NONE | If you want the raw text rather than parsed content.
|===

If these do change in the future, the replacement will be a compatible
implementation, that follows the normal GPath conventions.

If you want more advanced control over the slurping,
you can use Groovy's "Slurper" classes directly, e.g. `new XmlSlurper().parseText(...)`.

[[GroovyShell-sort]]

[[GroovyShell-widgets]]
=== Widgets

JLine provides a https://jline.org/docs/advanced/widgets/[powerful widget system]
that lets you extend the functionality of its line reader.
A number of builtin widgets are available including `end-of-line`, `beginning-of-line`, `forward-word`, `backward-word`, `kill-word`, `backward-kill-word`, `capitalize-word`, `transpose-words`, and `yank-pop`, just to name a few. You can use the `/keymap` command to see the key bindings for these widgets.

Groovy also includes JLine's _tailtip_ and _autosuggest_ widget functionality.
You can see the related widgets by using the `/widget -l` command, which lists custom widgets.

[source,shell]
----
groovy> /widget -l
_autosuggest-end-of-line (_autosuggest-end-of-line)
_autosuggest-forward-char (_autosuggest-forward-char)
_autosuggest-forward-word (_autosuggest-forward-word)
_tailtip-accept-line (_tailtip-accept-line)
_tailtip-backward-delete-char (_tailtip-backward-delete-char)
_tailtip-delete-char (_tailtip-delete-char)
_tailtip-expand-or-complete (_tailtip-expand-or-complete)
_tailtip-kill-line (_tailtip-kill-line)
_tailtip-kill-whole-line (_tailtip-kill-whole-line)
_tailtip-redisplay (_tailtip-redisplay)
_tailtip-self-insert (_tailtip-self-insert)
autosuggest-toggle (autosuggest-toggle)
tailtip-toggle (tailtip-toggle)
tailtip-window (tailtip-window)
----

These are available but not enabled by default.
You can enable them using the related _toggle_ widgets. You can see what
https://jline.org/docs/advanced/key-bindings[key bindings]
are associated with these widgets by using the `/keymap` command.

[source,shell]
----
groovy> /keymap
...
"^[s" tailtip-toggle
"^[v" autosuggest-toggle
...
----

Normally, completions are shown when you hit the 'TAB' key, but with the tailtip widget enabled,
you can see completions as you type., as well as additional usage information given in the
tailtip window as seen here for a command:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/widget1.png[Tailtip, width=80%]

And here for some code:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/widget3.png[Tailtip, width=60%]

With the autosuggest widget enabled, you can see suggestions for what to type next
as you type, based on your history, as seen here:

image:{reldir_groovysh}/assets/img/widget2.png[Tailtip,width=80%]

You can accept the entire suggestion or a word at a time. Both widgets can be enabled.

[[GroovyShell-Advanced]]
=== Advanced Topics

[[GroovyShell-ReplModelDetails]]
==== REPL Model Details

The style of coding you use in a REPL is slightly different from
what you might use in a script. The style you use may also depend on
whether you are using the Groovy Shell in _interpreter mode_ or not.

===== Using binding (shared) variables

Regardless of interpreter mode you can use shared variables:
[source,jshell]
----
groovy> fruit = []
groovy> fruit << 'peach'
[peach]
groovy> fruit << 'pear'
[peach, pear]
groovy> assert fruit == ['peach', 'pear']
----

Use the `/show` command to see the shared variables.

===== Using local variables

You should treat local variables as if you were using immutable data structures.
An input which mutates a local variable will likely be undone by subsequent statements.

Only in interpreter mode:
[source,jshell]
----
groovy> def noFruit = []
[]
groovy> def oneFruit = noFruit << 'peach'
[peach]
groovy> def twoFruit = oneFruit << 'pear'
[peach, pear]
groovy> assert twoFruit == ['peach', 'pear']
----

By the time you get to the last statement, the previous three local variable
definitions are remembered, so the assertion will pass.

Avoid this (relevant to interpreter mode):
[source,jshell]
----
groovy> def fruit = []
[]
groovy> fruit << 'peach'
[peach]
groovy> fruit << 'pear'
[pear]
groovy> assert fruit == []
----
The `def fruit = []` will be _remembered_ before executing each of the next three statements.

==== Gotchas

The Groovy Shell attempts to blend a Groovy programming environment with
a shell-like scripting environment. Sometimes the two are at odds.
As one example, don't try `/ls /tmp/*.txt`. The `/*` will be interpreted
as the start of a comment. Instead, quote the argument like this `/ls '/tmp/*.txt'`.

==== Platform Problems

The Groovy Shell relies heavily on the JLine3 library for its platform
support. If you have specific platform problems, please refer to the
JLine documentation.
