{groovy-www}[Groovy] is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine. It builds upon the strengths of Java, but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk.

Groovy makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve as well as supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain.

Groovy makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL.

It also increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications. Groovy simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box. Groovy also seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java.

== Downloading

Latest Groovy version is available on Bintray image:{bintray-latest-version-image}[Bintray latest version, link={bintray-latest-version-link}]

Binary distribution links are on the package page.

Maven, Gradle and Ivy dependency declaration snippets are available on specific files of a particular module.

== Obtaining the Source

You don't need the source code to use Groovy but if you wish to explore its inner workings or build it for yourself there are two ways to obtain the source files.

=== Checking out from Version Control

Apache Groovy uses Git. The official Git repository is at:

    http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-groovy.git

And a mirror is hosted on Github:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-groovy

The Github mirror is read-only and provides convenience to users and developers to explore the code and for the community to accept contributions via Github pull requests.

Simply `git clone` the repo (or the repo you forked via the github website) and you will have the complete source.

=== Unpacking the src distribution

Alternatively, you can download the source distribution and unpack it.

If obtaining the source from this distribution and you intend to build from source,
you also need to https://gradle.org/downloads/[download] and install http://gradle.org/[Gradle] and execute one bootstrap step.
At the top directory of your unpacked source, you need to run the command:

    gradle

This sets up the Gradle wrapper and from then on you just need the `gradlew` command instead of `gradle`.

== Building from Source

Build is image:{build-icon}[build status, link={groovy-ci}].

To build you will need:

* {jdk}[JDK 1.7+]

To build everything using Gradle:

    gradlew clean dist

Note: The gradlew command automatically downloads the correct Gradle version if needed, you do not need to download it first.

This will generate a distribution similar to the zip you can download on the Groovy download page.

To build everything and launch unit tests, use:

    gradlew test

If you want to launch one unit test, use this. <TestClassName> is like `groovy.GroovyMethodsTest`.

    gradlew :test --tests <TestClassName>

To build from IntelliJ IDEA:

    gradlew jarAll idea

Then open the generated project in IDEA.

To build from Eclipse:

    gradlew jarAll eclipse

Then open the generated project and the generated subprojects in Eclipse. But be aware that Eclipse tends to be more limited in its ability to reproduce a gradle build structure. The generated project files may contain a circular dependency which may or may not prevent Eclipse from using them. It depends on the Eclipse version, if this is an issue or not.

To build the documentation (Groovy Language Documentation):

    gradlew assembleAsciidoc

All code samples of the documentation guide are pulled from actual test cases.  To run a single documentation test case, take for example `src/spec/test/semantics/PowerAssertTest.groovy`

    gradlew testSinglePowerAssertTest

(note the omission of package name : class is `semantics.PowerAssertTest` but only `PowerAssertTest` is added to `testSingle`).


== InvokeDynamic support

The Groovy build supports the new Java 7 JVM instruction `invokedynamic`. If you want to build Groovy with invokedynamic, you can use the project property `indy`:

    gradlew -Pindy=true clean test

Please note that the following Gradle tasks generate both indy and non indy variants of the jars, so you don't need to use the system property:

* dist
* install
* uploadArchives

== Continuous Integration Server

The official CI server runs {groovy-ci}[here] (login as user guest and leave the password blank) and is sponsored by http://www.jetbrains.com[JetBrains].
